# Homework Assignment #5
The purpose of this homework assignment is still to get you acquainted with the modular design of a large program
in a procedure-oriented programming language, C.
 
This assignment requires that you build on the memory manager you wrote for the homework assignment 4 a
debugging facility that would be able to trace all the memory allocated and freed. You may want to include in
the debugging facility at least the name of the file, the name of the function, and the line number from which the
malloc function and its relatives are invoked so that they can be easily pinpointed if a problem actually occurs.
You are free to choose the data structures to keep track of all the information that you need. Also, please make
sure that at the end of your problem, all the memory allocated is actually freed.
